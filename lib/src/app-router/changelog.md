## app-router change log

#### v0.9.0
- Refactor `parseUrl()` to use the native `URL()` constructor and return additional information about the hash path.
- Cleaned up `testRoute()` and `routeArguments()` with additional information from `parseUrl()`.
- Moved utility functions to `AppRouter.util`.

#### v0.8.1
- Fixed bug where the regular path was being used when `pathType="hash"` was set on the router.

#### v0.8.0
- `template` no longer required on inline template routes.
- Only use `app-route`s that are direct children of the router by replacing `querySelector()` with `firstElementChild` and iterating with `nextSibling`.
- Took internal functions off the public API and simplified parameters.

#### v0.7.0
- Added the `pathType` attribute to the router. The options are `auto`, `hash`, and `regular`.
